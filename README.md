# simulator_course_2
Upgrade of messy PCS

I have some really nice decision based game made with React. But It was back when my skills were well..tiny. And that code was just outrageous. Not to mention one silly bug with creating new player, and many more sloppy(but working) ways. Gameplay was nice and my +80yo dad actually finished it as the only game in his life. Now I want to revive it and this time to make it available for the people. Game loosely simulates Python Bootcamp for beginner who wants to get a job right afterwards. And yes, this is also possible in real life still. Plan was to use Solid.js however due to lack of libs I decided to give it a go with React. Using firebase for backend. Of course I feel lost without TypeScript, so it is used here as well. It is under construction.
